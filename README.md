description: A community-led effort to explore the topic of on-chain governance on Solana

# ðŸ—’ Solana Governance Think Tank

## Introduction

This effort is a community-led exploration of the topic of on-chain governance. We explore the questions of why governance is necessary, what it actually entails, how it might be implemented and who would be participating in it.

{% hint style="info" %}
As it stands this is a first draft as presented by Michael from Laine and doesn't yet represent a community-formed view.
{% endhint %}

Primary discussion forum is [this Telegram group](https://t.me/+CNvn2-hKQRRiMWVk) - please feel free to join it if you're interested in participating.

This Gitbook serves as a place to capture the discussions as they evolve and formulate a framework of what the social consensus believes governance should look like.

{% hint style="info" %}
This effort and output is not binding and does not form a final decision on governance implementation. Any final implementation of a governance structure or process would require a full on-chain stake-weighted vote by validators.
{% endhint %}

## Scope

Initially, this document will begin by exploring some key questions:

* Why - why do we need governance
* Who - who participates in governance, in which roles
* What - what is governance, what areas, actions and policies does it cover
* How - how do we implement

## Principles

TBD - Suggested in TG chat

## Contributors
