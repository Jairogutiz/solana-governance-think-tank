# Solana Governance Insights

**Introduction**

As discussions about governance become increasingly prevalent and the concept of governance gains popularity, it's essential to share a detailed perspective that may challenge the prevailing consensus in these conversations.

## The Essence of Governance

My central argument regarding governance revolves around whether Solana stands to gain more from implementing a governance mechanism at its current stage or from abstaining. 

Within the community, debates are ongoing, addressing critical questions such as:

- What is the optimal governance form?
- Who should have the voting rights?
- How should voting power be distributed?

While I hold numerous thoughts on these questions, this discussion focuses on the fundamental question of whether governance benefits the Solana protocol in its current state.

## Quality of Decisions

In any context, be it a country, organization, project, or blockchain, the organization's structure is crucial. However, what ultimately matters most is not the organizational mechanism itself, but the quality of the decisions it produces.

This principle is self-evident: if a group decides on a poor course of action for its shared resources, it will inevitably suffer the consequences. The method used to arrive at this decision is secondary to its impact.

## Challenges of Popular Governance Mechanisms

In the crypto world, stake-weighted voting has become the standard governance mechanism. While it aligns with ideals of decentralization and fairness, it has shortcomings worth exploring.

Consider this analogy: imagine creating a company to manufacture electric cars and allowing everyone to vote on its decisions.

The flaws in this approach become evident:

- Decisions made by everyone tend to be average.
- Most individuals possess minimal knowledge of car manufacturing.
- In a highly competitive industry like car manufacturing, average decisions lead to failure.
- Expertise is diluted in a sea of uninformed votes.

These issues, though apparent to me, are prevalent in societies and groups that have adopted certain governance mechanisms. Evidence can be found in the fact that, in democratic systems, experienced leaders are sometimes overshadowed by less qualified candidates due to governance structures.

## The Unseen Downsides

One of the hidden drawbacks of such governance mechanisms is their influence on voter behavior. When voting for the fourth candidate, who has a 2% popularity, is as impactful as not voting at all, voters tend to opt for the lesser of several potential evils rather than the best option. This can lead to candidates spending more effort discrediting opponents than promoting their own ideas.

## Governance in Blockchains

Unlike governments, blockchains operate in a competitive landscape. Out of the top 15 cryptocurrencies that claimed their positions in 2018, only five remain in the top 15 today, and most have seen declines in their market share. 

The cryptocurrency world resembles more of a business ecosystem than a government. Here, making the right decisions takes precedence over the mechanisms employed to make them.

While stake-weighted voting in crypto is not the same as in democratic countries, it exhibits enough similarities to warrant scrutiny for its potential deficiencies.

## Corporate Shareholder Mechanisms

Contrast this with the governance mechanisms used by most car manufacturers in the United States, which primarily rely on corporate shareholder structures. Shareholders select directors, who appoint managers to run the companies. These systems, while not producing the best-performing stock market companies, generally function well in a competitive environment.

## Founder-Led Success

Consider the top seven companies in the S&P 500: Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Google, Tesla, and Facebook. These companies share a common thread – they were founded and led by visionaries who gained traction and executed their ideas.

- Apple, led by the iconic Steve Jobs.
- Microsoft, under the founder-led leadership of Bill Gates (1975–2000).
- Amazon, helmed by Jeff Bezos (1994–2021).
- Nvidia, with Jensen Huang as CEO (since 1993).
- Google, co-founded and still influenced by Larry Page and Sergey Brin (holding 56% of voting shares).
- Tesla, driven by the vision of Elon Musk.
- Facebook, led by Mark Zuckerberg.

These companies demonstrate that governance is not a prerequisite for making sound decisions. They suggest that the right visionary leader can outperform any governance mechanism.

## Adoption of Cryptocurrency

Turning our attention to cryptocurrency adoption, around 5 million people use blockchains daily, even though this estimate might be conservative. With 128 million registered users on Binance, one of the largest exchanges, the crypto market has reached a 1.6% adoption rate compared to the global population. This places it roughly at the 1995 stage of the internet adoption curve.

## Solana's Unique Position

Now, let's focus on Solana. With approximately 200,000 daily on-chain users and a market dominance of 0.73% within the 1.6% adoption rate, Solana is still in its infancy. At this stage, Solana stands to gain more from fostering a startup culture that prioritizes innovation over adopting a governance mechanism based on stake-weighted voting.

In my assessment, Anatoly appears to be one of the most principled thinkers in the crypto space. His approach of addressing problems from day one sets him apart from most founders who emphasize future vision over actual execution. For these reasons, I hold the humble opinion that governance, while well-intentioned, may pose more risks than benefits to the future of the Solana project.

## A Parallel with SpaceX

Drawing a parallel with SpaceX, the early days of rocket development witnessed numerous failures and explosions. Elon Musk emphasized the importance of the rate of innovation, asking whether it was accelerating or decelerating. This perspective also applies to Solana's multiple outages.

To unsophisticated observers, these outages might appear as grounds for dismissing the project. However, to those who understand the innovations built on Solana, these failures represent opportunities for continuous innovation. As long as they are not catastrophic events, failure can be a stepping stone to progress. Present-day SpaceX benefits from more structured rules and protocols, akin to governance, as the stakes are significantly higher for those flight that involve astronauts.

## Solana's Stage of Development

The critical question for Solana is whether it is in the early stages of its adoption curve or already established. If Solana were firmly established, I would advocate for a governance mechanism. However, I estimate that it is not the case. At this juncture, Solana stands to gain more from prioritizing the rate of innovation over the mechanisms governing rules and decisions.

In my view, Anatoly is likely the most qualified person to make decisions for the project at this time.

## Decentralization and Open Source

Critics may argue that a cryptocurrency must remain decentralized, with no centralized decision-making. I concur, but that does not preclude visionaries like Anatoly from garnering voluntary support. Moreover, everything developed by Solana Labs is open source, allowing the community to continue development if they believe Anatoly's vision no longer aligns with stakeholder interests.

## Governance in Crypto Projects

Historically, crypto projects that introduced governance often lost relevance to those that focused on technological advancements. Governance appeared to inhibit innovation in competitive crypto markets, where nearly every decision required governance approval.

## Conclusion

In closing, while I acknowledge valid concerns raised by participants in this conversation, my intent is not to dismiss them. Indeed, these concerns must be addressed, and communication with Labs engineers improved. However, in the best interest of the protocol and all stakeholders, I believe that, at this early stage of development, Solana should steer clear of implementing a governance mechanism.

I welcome criticism and feedback on my ideas, as they can guide us toward the best outcome for all.
