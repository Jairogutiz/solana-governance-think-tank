# Solana Governance Insights

**Introduction**

When the dialog about governance started to become more common, and the idea of governance started to become more popular I thought that perhaps my position which seems contrarian to that of the consensus perceived in the conversation. 
So, I wanted to share in more detail my thoughts about the topic. 


## The Essence of Governance

My main argument when it comes to governance is that it seems to me that Solana has a lot more to lose from having a governance mechanism at the current stage, than by not having one. 
There’s another debate about other kinds of questions that the community has been having, for example: 
 What’s the best form of governance? 
 Who should vote? 
 How is voting power allocated? 
 Etc. 
 
I have a lot of thoughts about these questions, but here I’m not going to go into the details of governance. The main idea that I want to explore is this question about how beneficial is governance to the Solana protocol at its current stage since one must believe first that something is beneficial before debating how to implement it. 

## Quality of Decisions

When it comes to a country, an organization, a project, or a blockchain, the way this group of people organizes themselves around is very important, but the most important thing is not the organization mechanism, but the quality of the decisions. 
This idea seems self-evident, if a group of people decides that the best thing to do with the resources of the group is to use them on a terrible decision, the group will lose those resources and therefore suffer from that loss (An example of this may be the multiple times populations have elected communist leaders), The way one may reach that idea is irrelevant in comparison to the consequences of implementing the idea, so making good decisions is more important than the mechanism one employed to get to that decision. 

## Challenges of Popular Governance Mechanisms

When it comes to the governance mechanisms more popular in crypto spheres, stakeweight voting seems to be the Defacto, and although the ideas of decentralization, and fairness seem usually to be associated with voting governance mechanisms it's no wonder why these forms of governance become popular among most people. 
But I want to perhaps push back a bit on these ideas, by reframing the question, so that the disadvantages of governance become more apparent, and my ideas more understood. 
Let’s say I wanted to create a company to build electric cars, and the mechanism that I decided to employ to make decisions to create this car company is by allowing everybody to vote. 
it would very apparently come as a really bad idea: 
A decision taken by everybody is by definition average. 
The average knowledge a person has about car manufacturing is very close to 0. 
Car manufacturing is a very competitive field, taking average decisions is by definition a losing strategy. 
The vote of the guy who has decades of experience manufacturing cars is worth as much as the guy who spends most of his weekends drinking like there’s no tomorrow. 
The vote of those that know about the topic, would be diluted in a sea of uninformed votes. 
These ideas, although self-evident at least to me, plague society, and groups of people, because of the governance mechanisms they’ve imposed on themselves, we don’t have to look that much for evidence to find the two most likely candidates for the most powerful position in the world to be +70 years old grandpas (Trump and Biden) with varying degrees of mental clarity.  
If some advanced civilization arrived on earth and examined our political system their heads would explode processing the idea that among the extensive pool of talent that exists in the United States, these two guys that would hardly get a position in the private sector in a competitive field just because of their age, would be the two most popular options among voters for the most important position in the world. 
But what about all the candidates that may perhaps be better options than these two guys, How come? 

## The Unseen Downsides

The unseen downside of these governance mechanisms is that they also modify the behavior of voters, Since voting for the 4th candidate which has a popularity of 2% is as impactful as just not voting at all voters tend to just vote for the least bad among the potential winners, rather than from the best option. 
This also drives a bunch of unseen incentives, in which one candidate may find it more worthy to spend time discrediting the other candidate than persuading people about his ideas. 
And here’s where perhaps the downside in the idea of governance becomes more apparent. 

## Governance in Blockchains

Luckily for governments, they don’t have competition, so this system keeps perpetuating until the debts (accumulation of bad decisions) become so big that they hyperinflate the currency, but that’s a topic for another day. 
“Sadly” for Solana, this is not the case when it comes to blockchains, Out of the Top 15 cryptocurrencies that claimed these positions in 2018, today only 5 of those are still in the top 15, and most of them have seen declines in their total market share, it’s very clear the cryptocurrency landscape resembles more that of a car company than that of a government, in which making the right decisions is more crucial than the mechanisms one employs to make those decisions. 
Now to be fair the stake weight voting mechanism is not equivalent to that of most democratic countries, but it seems that it’s close enough that one may perhaps learn from the deficiencies that a governance mechanism like that is prone to. 

## Corporate Shareholder Mechanisms

Now, coming back to my car company example, when one looks at the governance mechanisms of most of the car manufacturers in the US for example, it’s mostly a corporate shareholder mechanism, in which shareholders pick the directors, who appoint managers, who in turn, run corporations, and for the most part, these systems work. These kinds of companies are for the most part not even close to the best-performing companies in the stock market, but they do seem to work somewhat okay in the competitive environment if you don’t account for the multiple times the government has had to bail them out. 

## Founder-Led Success

One may ask, what’s the best governance mechanism that will lead to the best decisions being made since we already established that the quality of decisions is more important than the mechanism one employs to get them? And it’s impossible to ignore the evidence, or rather extremely unlikely coincidence right there in the top 7 companies in the S&P 500, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Google, Tesla, and Facebook, they all have in common one thing, they were founder-led companies, one guy with a vision of what the future could look like, that gained enough traction and that was allowed to execute on those ideas. 
Apple with the iconic Steve Jobs. 
The founder-led Microsoft with Bill Gates as CEO (1975–2000)  
The founder-led Amazon with Jeff Bezos as CEO (1994–2021) 
The founder-led Nvidia with Jensen Huang as CEO (1993–Today) 
The founder led Google with Larry Page and Sergey Brin which still today together hold 56% of the voting shares. 
The iconic Tesla with Elon Musk. 
The iconic Facebook with Mark Zuckerberg. 
At least these companies serve as evidence that governance is not a requisite to making good decisions and perhaps are evidence of the opposite, that the right guy, with the right vision, is vastly superior to any governance mechanisms humanity has come up with. 

## Adoption of Cryptocurrency

And here is where I may perhaps ask the reader to look at the facts, if one looks at the on-chain metrics (1), one can estimate that around 5 million people may be using blockchains daily, but let’s try to convey as much users as possible, since a lot of the userbase on less scalable chains tends to congregate on centralized exchanges, Based on exchange registered users Binance, the largest exchange has about 128 million registered users (2), not all registered users are active users but one can start to get an idea of the most optimistic user base estimates. Since there are 8 billion people in the world, assuming crypto has 128 million users, crypto is currently at an adoption rate of 1.6% of the world population, which puts us at around 1995 in the adoption bell curve of the internet. 

## Solana's Unique Position

Now back to Solana, estimates of the on-chain user base are currently around 200k daily, currently Solana has a market dominance of 0.73% within that already small mere 1.6% adoption rate, this technology is still in its infancy, to which it seems to me that it’s quite evident that Solana has a lot more to gain from a startup culture where innovation is put as the most important value, than as a protocol in which decisions are made based on stake weight voting. 
As far as I've been able to judge, Anatoly seems to me like one of the most first-principle thinkers in all of crypto, and his approach to tackling problems from day one, as opposed to most founders where their crypto project can be characterized more in terms of a future vision, than an actuality, for these and a lot more reasons, it’s my humble opinion that governance although an idea with good intentions, it’s more likely to have more downside, than upside to the future of the project. 


## A Parallel with SpaceX

The simplest comparison that I can make about this idea is that of SpaceX, when SpaceX first started developing rockets, most of their rockets would simply just fail and explode, in this stage the most important value to be had in the company as Elon Musk multiple times said, “the rate of innovation is what matters, and is the rate of innovation accelerating or decelerating?”, I can’t help but make parallels to Solana's Mutiple outages, which to the unsophisticated observer may seem like a good reason to dismiss the project, but to the sophisticated observer knowing all the innovations that are built on Solana, knows that it’s better to fail and keep innovating, than not failing and having a rate of innovation that is a lot slower, as long as it is not a catastrophic event, Now in the present SpaceX benefits from a set of rules, and protocols something resembling governance in the development of their older models since now the stakes are really high, they routinely have been sending astronauts to the ISS, and since there’s a lot in stake, it benefits a lot more, from a more thought out, and slow process of development. 

## Solana's Stage of Development

I may ask the reader if they consider Solana to be in the early stage of its adoption curve, or the already established stage if Solana were in the already established stage, I would without a doubt advocate for a governance mechanism since it probably would gain more from having standards, and protocols when it comes to doing things, but I estimate that that’s not the case, and currently Solana has a lot more to gain from focusing on the rate of innovation rather than the mechanism by which the rules, and decisions are being made, because I think Anatoly is probably the most qualified person to making those decisions at the present moment. 

## Decentralization and Open Source

Now some people have rightly so criticized a couple of my ideas, based on the principle that a cryptocurrency must be decentralized and there shouldn’t be some centralized entity making the decisions, to which I agree, but that doesn’t mean that there are not people like Anatoly with a convincing vision that a lot of people voluntarily want to rally around, and fundamentally everything being developed by Solana labs is open source, so all that code is always available for anyone in the community to continue developing if at some point if part of the community estimates that Anatoly's vision is no longer in the interest of the stakers, As long as that part of the community reasons for forking from the lab's client is based on solid arguments, they will always be able to persuade a good percentage of stakers. 

## Governance in Crypto Projects

And if history serves as an example most of the crypto projects that I've been interested in over time, that have implemented the idea of governance, have indirectly been slowly losing relevance to projects that have developed simply better technology, It’s my guess that the effects of governance on blockchains, tends to be similar to that of governance in the political sphere, in which the side effects of these ideas is the taking of suboptimal decisions, and the slowdown of innovation in the projects, since most things now have to go through a governance approval, and in such a competitive environment as the crypto markets, that’s the perfect recipe for the slowdown of innovation and eventual irrelevance over the long run. 

## Conclusion

In closing, while I acknowledge valid concerns raised by participants in this conversation, my intent is not to dismiss them. Indeed, these concerns must be addressed, and communication with Labs engineers improved. However, in the best interest of the protocol and all stakeholders, It seems to me that at this early stage of development, Solana implementing a governance mechanism has a lot more downside than upside.

I am looking forward to criticism of my ideas to lead the conversation in the best outcome for everybody.
