# What

An initial, incomplete list of types of governance decisions that may exist in an L1 environment such as Solana:

* Protocol-altering technical changes
  * Major
  * Minor
* Economic changes (e.g. inflation)
* Possibly community fund spending
* Changes to governance itself

Initially minor protocol-altering technical changes should likely not fall under governance, e.g. altering the account of a native program or a SYSVAR to accommodate more data as part of a performance or feature enhancement.

Major protocol changes as well as economic changes should likely fall under governance.

Whether a community fund should or will exist is a further debate. The Solana Foundation administers an ecosystem fund, and there is a case to be made that some portion of this should potentially be made available for administration through governance, e.g. for grants or other development that the community wishes to decide on, independent of the Foundation.
