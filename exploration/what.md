# What

An initial, incomplete list of types of governance decisions that may exist in an L1 environment such as Solana:

* Technology
  * Protocol-altering technical changes
    * Major
    * Minor
  * Parameter updates
  * Changes to consensus thresholds (ideally these are on-chain parameters), such as supermajority definition, fork switch threshold etc
  * Upgrade timelines and approvals
  * Client adoption
  * Feature activation
  * [SIMD](https://www.soldev.app/simd) Implementation approval (SIMD published, initial debate finalized, vote on whether to implement) (Possibly move to the "How" section?)
* Economics
  * Inflation and staking rewards changes
  * Transaction fees (especially once transaction fees have been overhauled and hopefully include on-chain parameters)
  * Minimum commission
* Governance
  * Adoption of the iniial governance process
  * Changes to governance itself
* Treasury management
  * Grants (if funding exists)
  * Community fund spending (if funding exists)
* Social
  * Votes on censure of validator behavior
  * Terminology/naming of things

Initially minor protocol-altering technical changes should likely not fall under governance, e.g. altering the account of a native program or a SYSVAR to accommodate more data as part of a performance or feature enhancement.

Major protocol changes as well as economic changes should likely fall under governance.

Whether a community fund should or will exist is a further debate. The Solana Foundation administers an ecosystem fund, and there is a case to be made that some portion of this should potentially be made available for administration through governance, e.g. for grants or other development that the community wishes to decide on, independent of the Foundation.
