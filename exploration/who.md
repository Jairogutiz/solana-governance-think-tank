# Who

There are numerous stakeholders to an L1 governance process. These include the teams building the clients, the operators (validators & RPC operators), the token-holders (delegators), as well as all the other projects and teams building on the L1 who may be impacted by governance decisions.

It is important to create a forum that allows all stakeholders to be heard and to participate actively, fairly and constructively.

At the same time it is important to determine clearly how decisions are made. Solana uses a delegated proof of stake protocol, whereby token-holders delegate the power of their tokens to validators, who use this power to vote on the validity of blocks of transactions.

It seems natural that if validators may choose which blocks and thus which transactions are valid (and currently one validator at a time also chooses which transactions even go into blocks), that this same delegated voting power is used for governance.

It is however likely still desirable to permit other stakeholders (i.e. anyone) to create governance proposals (with disincentives for abuse), to participate in debate around proposals and to lobby for a particular outcome.
