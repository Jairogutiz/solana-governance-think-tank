# Proposal collateral

To prevent abuse and spam users creating a proposal could be asked to provide collateral. This concept exists on Cosmos for instance.

The collateral would begin at a fixed nominal amount, e.g. 10 SOL, and increase with every active non-resolved proposal that exists, thus creating a disincentive to spam new proposals before older ones are voted upon.&#x20;

The proposer would receive back their full collateral regardless of whether the proposal passes or fails, except where the plurality has voted for ["No with veto"](voting-options-and-slashing.md), this is a dissenting vote that further wants to slash the collateral of the proposer, to be used for proposals that are extremely bad, harmful or time-wasting.
