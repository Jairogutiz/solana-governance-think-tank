# Quorum

Quorum is a tricky and potentially dangerous topic. Too high and most proposals will fail because quorum is not met, too low and it presents an attack vector.

Solana has an unusually engaged validator community, however one must be wary of governance fatigue as well. This relates to the [What](../exploration/what.md) and ensuring there aren't too frequent and trivial or excessively technical proposals that tire operators and ultimately lead to a decay in participation.

It will require some trial to observe a suitable number for a quorum, especially as participation is likely to be heightened initially before tapering off to a sustainable level.&#x20;

A potential initial quorum number might be 50%, with a view of iterating quickly should this prove too high (rather start high and move lower than vice versa).
