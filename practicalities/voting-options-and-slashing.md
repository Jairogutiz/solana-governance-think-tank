# Voting options & slashing

The voting options that should exist at a minimum are

* Yes
* No
* Abstain

Additionally an interesting option observed in the Cosmos ecosystem is&#x20;

* No with veto

This pertains to [Proposal Collateral](proposal-collateral.md) and serves as a method of slashing the posted collateral where a proposal is completely wasteful of the DAO's time, or intentionally malicious or otherwise deserving of such slashing.

A proposal should require a simple or super majority to pass (needs to be discussed).
